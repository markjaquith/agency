I'm trying to get semantic-release working with OICD Trusted Publishing.

NPM is set up correctly. `release.yml` is configured as per the documentation.

This was previously working for publishing via "changesets", but now I want to use semantic-release.

Semantic-release seems to think that I need an NPM token, but with OIDC Trusted Publishing, I thought that wasn't necessary. So something about my release process or configuration (on the GitHub side) must be off.

Please look at semantic-release's documentation for OICD Trusted Publishing and help me figure out what I'm missing.
